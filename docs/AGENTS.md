# Agent Guidance

This project includes a human-authored logbook at `docs/EOCLabbook.md`. It captures free-form notes, ideas, and context gathered while working on the system.

* You are encouraged to read the logbook when orienting yourself or when looking for historical reasoning, but do not treat its content as authoritative requirements. Treat it as inspiration and background, not as specification.*
* Never edit or overwrite the logbook. Leave every entry intact, even if newer decisions supersede earlier thoughts.*
* If you derive action items or requirements from the logbook, cross-check them against the current code, documentation, and user requests before executing.*

Following these practices keeps the logbook useful as a human narrative while ensuring the agent bases work on verified, up-to-date sources.
