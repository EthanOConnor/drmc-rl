# Archive (Read Only If Necessary)

This directory contains **historical** artifacts that are kept for provenance (old handoff writeups,
obsolete instructions, external reference snapshots, etc.). The contents here are **not**
authoritative and may be out of date.

Preferred sources of truth:
- `docs/` for current documentation/specs.
- `notes/MEMORY.md` for durable design decisions (ADR-lite).
- `notes/WORKLOG.md` for a chronological work log.
- `notes/BACKLOG.md` and `notes/SCRUTINY.md` for roadmap + risks.

If you find something useful here, extract the relevant parts into `docs/` or `notes/` and keep the
archived file as a historical record.
