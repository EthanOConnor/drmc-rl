## 2025-10-17 – Coding Agent (Codex CLI)

- Confirmed ROM revision (Dr. Mario Japan/USA rev0, CRC32 0xB1F7E3E9).
- Extracted and validated RAM map from disassembly.
- Implemented RAM→state mapping in `envs/specs/ram_to_state.py`.
- Added tests and CLI tooling (`tools/ram_planes_dump.py`).
- Documented RNG, virus placement, and state spec in `docs/`.

## 2025-11-22 – Coding Agent

- Implemented C++ game engine core logic (`game_engine/GameLogic.cpp`).
- Completed RNG, level generation, basic gravity/matching/clearing.
- Set up shared memory IPC between engine and Python.
- Created monitor tool for visual debugging (`game_engine/monitor.cpp`).

## 2025-01-04 – Coding Agent

- Completed SMDP-PPO placement policy implementation.
- Implemented 3 policy heads: dense, shift_score, factorized.
- Created `MaskedPlacementDist` for action masking.
- Added `DecisionRolloutBuffer` with SMDP discounting (Γ=γ^τ).
- Created training launcher (`training/launches/train_placement_smdp_ppo.py`).
- All 12 unit tests passing.
- Documented in `PLACEMENT_POLICY_IMPLEMENTATION.md` and `IMPLEMENTATION_COMPLETE.md`.

## 2025-12-16 – Coding Agent (Antigravity)

- Performed comprehensive codebase review.
- Created developer handoff report with prioritized findings.
- Identified critical gaps: no notes system, C++ engine missing DAS/wall kicks.
- Found 64 tests all passing.
- Implemented inter-session notes system (`notes/` directory).
